            Electronics and Communication Engineering from Calicut
            University,India. Thereafter for a year, I worked as an assistant
            PLC-programmer.And in year 2014, I relocated to Osnabr√ºck, Germany
            since my husband worked there. After completing my German language
            studies, I completed an advanced training in SIEMENS S7
            PLC-Programming since I wanted to work in automation field. Right
            after that I got opportunities from different firms, which I had
            to refuse due to the mandatory travelling requirement that came
            with all the automation job offers. Then as I was thinking about
            my next options, a friend of mine, who is also a software
            developer, told me about the rising oppurtunities in software
            programming field. I figured since I like programming electronics
            machines, I might also like coding. I went home and as I
            researched I was clear, Javascript is the language I wanted to
            learn and Web development is the direction I wanted to go. And
            ever since I created my first plain html page, I wanted to learn
            more...
